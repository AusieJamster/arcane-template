# Create T3 App With Clerk!

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`. I have added [clerk](https://clerk.com/) and [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) to this project so I can template it for future projects.

You will need to generate a clerk key from [the clerk dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/) and [PlanetScale](https://app.planetscale.com/) and add those to an `.env` file in the root of the project.

```
- DATABASE_URL
- NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
- CLERK_SECRET_KEY
```
